This repository contains a C++ implementation of the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. The 0/1 Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem that aims to maximize the total value of items that can be carried in a knapsack of a given capacity.

## Problem Statement

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the maximum value that can be carried in a knapsack of a given capacity. Each item can either be included in the knapsack or excluded (hence the name 0/1).

### Input
- W: Maximum weight capacity of the knapsack.
- weights[]: Array of weights of the items.
- values[]: Array of values of the items.
- n: Number of items.

### Output
- Maximum value that can be carried in the knapsack.
